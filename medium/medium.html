        <p>After going over the reading, it brought some questions I was thinking before. But I don't know if it's because of these new forms media we grew up with, but the way we recieve and react to news today is far different than how people a decade ago would react. Maybe it's because everything is all digital, but society doesn't take anything serious nowadays. For example when people heard about the bombings in Iraq, people were quick to make jokes and that was what was talked about in social media. Same with the virus, at first people didn't care about it and people didn't think it would affect them. And also started making jokes, however once they actually saw the consequences, they cared and stopped making alot of jokes. Even when it started in China, you could tell it would spread and be serious, but I'm not sure, if again it's cause of this new form of media in the internet, but people disregarded it. Until for example it affected the class of 2020, when graduation and prom was cancelled then everyone complained and panicked. I feel like the internet is supposed to connect everyone across the world, and since we got the news about a global pandemic before it came to the US we could've been more prepared. However people only were concered when it was too late.</p>
